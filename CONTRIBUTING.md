# How to contribute

## Did you find a bug?

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/RStankov/graphql-playground-rails/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/RStankov/graphql-playground-rails/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or a**executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

## Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

## Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?

* Run `bundle exec rake rubocop` to make sure you follow the project style guide.
* Run `bundle exec spec` and the example project to make sure your code does what is expected to do.

## Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?

* Suggest your change by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/RStankov/graphql-playground-rails/issues/new).

## Do you have questions about the source code or features?
